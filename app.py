# When you containerize your Flask app using Docker and expose it to the outside world, you need to specify the host
# parameter in the app.run() function to make the app accessible from outside the container.

# When you run a Flask app inside a Docker container, the default host value localhost refers only to the local
# container, not to the outside world. To make a Flask app accessible from outside the container, you need to set the
# host parameter to 0.0.0.0 so that it listens on all network interfaces.
